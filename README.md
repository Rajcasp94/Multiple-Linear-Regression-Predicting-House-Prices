# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Predicting-House-Prices
This is the code for the hacker rank challenge: Multiple Linear Regression: Predicting House Prices
This piece of code has three functions: 
(i) collect_training_data: This function takes the number of features and the number of observations as parameters and returns the training data set
(ii) collect_test_data: This function takes the number of features and the number of test cases as parameters and returns the test data set.
(iii) regression_analysis: This function estimates the line of best fit and predicts the house prices for test cases. The model used in this code is simple linear regression. Although, implementation of decision tree regressor and adaboost regressor are also provided in comments.
